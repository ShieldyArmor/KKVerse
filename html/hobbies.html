    <h1 class="text-center mt-3">Welcome to the hobbies page</h1>
    <h5 class="text-center">Here I will talk about things that I believe could be useful information for any sort of employer or person that wants to get to know me better.</h5>

    <div class="col-md-6 me-5">
        <h3 class="text-center mt-3 mb-2">Programming and creativity</h3>
        <p class="text-end">My adventure with programming began ever since I was very young. I used to play way more games than I do now, even. I remember thinking about how these games were actually made, hoping that one day perhaps I could deepen myself into the career of being a programmer. Which followed by my brother starting to go to university when i was about 11. and Knowing he was doing that type of thing himself, and was capable of creating software on the computer blew my mind.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text-end mb-5">Since then, I was always partly interested in the concept of programming, whether it be making games or some simple project. And starting at vocational school like Bleiker really helped me set my mind on this concept. Not to mention, I would like to believe I am quite a creative person, and with the power to have a high drive for working for hours at a time if the project is something for me. By this I don't just mean ideas in general, I believe that my varied culture and mentality could give very unique input that could make a nieche change for the better.</p>

            <h3 class="text-center mt-3 mb-2">Gaming and mentality</h3>
            <p class="text-start">When it comes to games, my taste has most defenitely changed over the past 10 years. Going from COD and generic shooters, to more strategic and brain-intensive games, Such as: League of legends, Arma 3, The Binding of Isaac and Overwatch, just to name a few.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="text-start">As someone who has been through a lot mentally due to my earlier years in school to do with bullying, this of course was a thing happening online as well. And fortunately I managed to keep myself in a healthy mindset for a majority of my older years. And things like managing my own Arma 3 unit helped me stay more organized and feel how it is really to be someone that a lot of people rely on to have fun each week, like managing a sports team. All in the meanwhile with the help of Lier IL E-sport I am able to spend 2 hours each week at the moment coaching younger kids on how to play League of Legends</p>

        <h3 class="text-center mt-3 mb-2">Personality and niche things</h3>
        <p class="text-end">I wanted to end off this page with a general summary of myself, trying to be as truthful as possible, of course.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text-end">I believe that like most people, I am able to adapt to the environment that I am in at the given time. I am able to be very social and crack jokes more than everyone combined, or If needed, I am able to stay still, focus and barely talk at all. It is very much dependant on how the day is going for me as well. But I try my best to help people sometimes no matter how bad my own situation is, which is probably my biggest con yet also one of my best qualities depending on the matter.</p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text-end mb-5">I'm sure that I am capable of having very strong connections with the right people. Even if I sometimes may speak poetically and metaphorically. I think that the best thing to take away from all of this is that as a person, even if I may seem off-putting in bigger groups. I am able to care about people on an individual level and help them out to the best of my ability.</p>
